# The QTPlasma Build for my cnc table 

This is the working up to date configuration of my 5' x 10' cnc robot, I combined a plasma torch and 3 hp router onto a single head with a useable table area of 49" x 98", I used a mesa 7i96 for step generation and critical i/o,  a 7i84 for future i/o upgrades,  Thcad-10 for reading arc voltage, and a thcad-2 for ohmic sensing. I'm using a hypertherm xp-45 for my plasma source with machine torch and fine cut consumables
